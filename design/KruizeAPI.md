# Kruize REST API

This article describes how to quickly get started with the Kruize REST API using The "curl" command. Kruize API is
organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns
JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Components

Kurize APIs are designed to work for one or more use cases based on cluster location and mode.

* ### Remote Monitoring Mode

Find a set of [APIs](/design/MonitoringModeAPI.md) that can be used if the cluster is "remote" and the mode is "
monitoring".

* ### Experiment Trial Mode

Find a set of [APIs](/design/ExperimentModeAPI.md) that can be used if the cluster is "local" and the mode is "
experiment".
